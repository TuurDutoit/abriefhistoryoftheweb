            "On 7 march 1876, Alexander Graham Bell registers a patent for \"the method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically (...)\". In simpler terms: the telephone.<br />Of course, many other scientists were working on the telephone, including Thomas Edison, Elisha Gray and Antonio Meucci, leading to many lawsuits about patent claims in the years following the registering of Bell's patent. However, Bell won all the battles.",
            "In 1877, A. G. Bell founded the Bell Telephone Company, the company that would run the phone lines for the forseeable future and would - as we now know - play a vital role in our story."

            "Around the 1900s, the growth of the Bell Telephone Company (by that time called AT&T) is getting really problematic: vacuum tubes were used to amplify and connect lines, but these were bulky, unreliable and required lots of power. So, at the end of World War II, a research team, including Bill Shockley, Walter Brattain and John Bardeen, was created at Bell Labs, AT&T's research arm.",
            "In 1945, Shockley had designed what he hoped would be the first semiconductor amplifier. The device was a cylinder, coated with silicon and mounted close to a small, metal plate. Unfortunately, it didn't work.",
            "In 1947, Brattain tried putting the whole device in a tub of water, and surprisingly, it worked ... a little bit.",
            "Following more experiments, Brattain replaced the silicon with germanium and used gold instead of metal. These changes allowed a much better amplification. They had invented the point-contact transistor.",
            "However, Shockley was furious because he hadn't been involved directly with the invention, so he set to work and, a month later, he came up with a new design, the junction transistor, which was a lot easier to manufacture.",
            "The transistor went on to replace the bulky vacuum tubes and revolutionized the world of electronics."
