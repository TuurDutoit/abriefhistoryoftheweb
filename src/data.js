However, Bell won all the battles.",

            "Around the 1900s, the Bell Telephone Company (by that time called AT&T) was having a few problems. First, they had trouble using inter-continental phone lines: while travelling through thousands of kilometers of wire, the signals would get weaker and weaker, and arriving at the other end of the line, they were barely audible. Luckily, a few scientists were already experimenting with vacuum tubes, and they found out that they were not only able to amplify signals, but perform some logic tasks also. Within a few years, vacuum tubes were used all over the telephone networks to amplify and relay connections.",
            "But, again a few years later, vacuum tubes turned out to be bulky, unreliable and very power hungry. So, at the end of World War II, a research team, including Bill Shockley, Walter Brattain and John Bardeen, was created at Bell Labs - AT&T's research arm - to develop an alternative to these tubes.",
            "In 1945, Shockley had designed what he hoped would be the first semiconductor amplifier. The device was a cylinder, coated with silicon and mounted close to a small, metal plate. Unfortunately, it didn't work.",
            "In 1947, Brattain tried putting this whole device in a tub of water, and surprisingly, it worked ... a little bit.",
            "Following more experiments, Brattain replaced the silicon with germanium and used gold instead of metal. These changes allowed a much better amplification. They had invented the point-contact transistor.",
            "However, Shockley was furious because he hadn't been involved directly with the invention, so he set to work and, a month later, he came up with a new design, the junction transistor, which was a lot easier to manufacture.",
            "The transistor went on to replace the bulky vacuum tubes and allowed a much faster evolution of the world of electronics."

            "Let's be clear about this: <i>the</i> first computer doesn't exist: it was an evolution beginning a long, long time ago.",
            "The first 'computers' were simple computation aids, like counting rods, counting frames (abacus), tally sticks, slide rules, sectors, etc. Whether they can count as computers is highly susceptible.",
            "During the Hellenistic period, many complex devices were used to perform complex calculations. Good examples are the planisphere - a mechanical star chart - and the astrolabe, which was used to solve astronomy problems.",
            "When the Roman Empire fell and the Middle Ages began, however, humanity was back to the simple calculation aids. Until, closer to the nineteenth century, analog computers saw the light of day. Analog computers are a class of mechanical devices that are made for a specific purpose, which is baked in the design: they perform one task or one type of calculations, much like the Hellenistic devices. Again, whether they count as computers is highly susceptible.",
            "During the nineteenth century, some engineers already experimented with general-purpose, programmable devices. But, limited by the mechanical nature of the devices, they weren't very successful.",
            "At the beginning of the twentieth century, a turning point was reached. In 1936, Alan Turing - arguably the greatest computer scientist of all times - published his paper 'On Computable Numbers', in which he deals with many topics that now make up the fundamentals of computer science. One such topic is the fully programmable machine: a machine that knows a basic set of operations and can then be programmed to follow an algorithm using those operations. In other words: a computer, as we know it.",
            "Using vacuum tubes, and later transistors, this new concept was being applied en masse in new computers built all around the globe. The Bell Telephone Company, the military, lots of universities and a lot of other companies quickly started using the new computers, for all sorts of tasks.",
            "The only problem was that vacuum tubes and even transistors were still quite bulky: to build a computer you need a few thousand transistors. That's why around 1970 the idea of a 'microprocessor' emerged: a integrated electrical circuit, consisting of thousands of miniscule transistors, all placed on a single small chip. In 1971, this became a reality: Intel unveiled the 4004, the first 4-bit microprocessor. From there, the growth of the computer industry seems unstoppable."

The most notable network was ARPANET, developed by the US Department of Defense, while searching for a flexible communication method that didn't depend on a central backbone. The first connection of ARPANET was initiated on 29 October 1969. The Internet quickly expanded to other universities and beyond and was fully commercialized by 1995.",

It was originally meant to be used within CERN, but he realized his concept had great potential to be used in other fields.",

            "The Browser Wars is an ongoing series of fights for the dominance in the usage share of web browsers. Over time, many different browsers were born and faded, and with them fights erupted or died away. Let me tell you the whole, thrilling story.",
            "<h3>The First Browser War</h3>From 1991, after Tim Berners-lee published his WorldWideWeb browser, a lot of other browsers were developed, the most influential of which was Mosaic. It was extremely popular and by October 1994 it was said to be '<i>well on its way to becoming the world's standard interface</i>'.<br />Mosaic was even licensed by several companies to create their own commercial browsers.",
            "On 4 April 1994, Marc Andreessen, one of the Mosaic developers, founded <i>Mosaic Communications Corporation</i>, later renamed <i>Netscape Communications Corporation</i>, and created a new web browser called <i>Netscape Navigator</i>. It improved on Mosaic's usability and reliability and could display web pages as they loaded. This, and the fact the it was free for non-commercial use, made Netscape the dominant browser by 1995.",
            "In 1995, Microsoft released Internet Explorer 1. It was just a first version, and Netscape dominated the market, so it wasn't very wildly used.",
            "Only three months later, however, Microsoft released Internet Explorer 2.0, and made it available for free for eveyone, including for commercial use. New versions of both Netscape and Internet Explorer followed at a rapid pace and features were routinely added: Netscape implemented JavaScript (later replicated by Microsoft as JScript) and proprietary HTML tags, like <blink> and &lt;marquee&gt; were added.",
            "In 1996, Internet Explorer nearly reached feature parity with Netscape with version 3.0, which offered scripting support and the first implementation of CSS.",
            "In October 1997, Internet Explorer 4.0 was released. The release party in San Francisco featured a ten-foot-tall 'e' logo, which Netscape employees found on their front lawn with a sign attached reading '<i>From the IE team ... We love you.</i>'. They promptly knocked it over and placed a giant figure of their Mozilla dinosaur mascot on top, holding a sign reading '<i>Netscape 72, Microsoft 18</i>', representing the market distribution.",
            "The rivalry between Netscape and Microsoft didn't only bring innovation to the Web, but also a lot of fragmentation: they both had their own features, which the other didn't support, resulting in unpredictable rendering of web pages. This was a pain for webdevelopers at the time, so they would often include badges reading '<i>Best viewed in Netscape</i>' or '<i>Best viewed in Internet Explorer</i>' on their websites.",
            "With versions 5 and 6 of Internet Explorer, Microsoft was steadily overtaking Netscape. There were two reasons for this: <ol><li>Netscape's only revenue came from their browser, which made them financially vulnerable. Microsoft on the other hand, had virtually unlimited resources and could thus easily make Internet Explorer completely free to use.</li><li>Microsoft had a huge advantage over Netscape, because it installed Internet Explorer by default on all Windows installations. Most computer purchases at the time were first computer purchases, so most users had never extensively used a web browser. As a result, they had nothing to compare with and little motivation to consider alternatives.</li></ol>",
            "In 1998, Netscape threw in the towel and was acquired by America Online for $4.2 billion.",
            "This is when the first Browser War: Internet Explorer had no serious competition anymore. This also brought an end to the rapid innovation of web browsers: until 2006, just one new version of Internet Explorer was released since version 6.0 in 2001.",
            "<h3>The Second Browser War</h3>After their defeat, Netscape open-sourced their code, which was picked up by the Mozilla Foundation, a project to create a successor to Netscape Navigator.<br />In 2004, a few things happened. In April, Opera and Mozilla joined forces and created the WHATWG, a working group dedicated to the fast creation of new Web standards that would be submitted to the W3C, the Web's standards body. A few months later, on 9 November, Firefox 1.0 was released. Its market share would slowly grow until 2010, after which it would remain largely stable.<br />Finally 2004 was also the year that the newly-formed WHATWG began to work on HTML5, the new and revolutionary Web standard. This task was only finished on 28 October 2014, when the specification was formally approved by the W3C.",
            "The following years, a lot of small things happened in the browser world, but I won't go into detail on that.",
            "However, on 11 December 2008, all these events led to the first release of Google Chrome. It was fully standards-compliant, it was simple, it was fast and, because it was open source, it worked everywhere. These traits, and the backing of a huge software giant, are the reasons why Chrome is now the dominant browser.",
            "Microsoft, Mozilla, Opera, Apple and a lot of other browser vendors are still fighting hard, so the Browser Wars are absolutely not over. However, it looks like Chrome will be at the top for the forseeable future."

            "In 1991, NCR and AT&T invented the precursor to Wi-Fi, intended to be used in cashier systems. They did some further developement and, in 1997, the standard was registered as IEEE 802.11; it allowed speeds of up to 2 Mbit/s. Two years later, in 1999, the Wi-Fi Alliance, which holds the Wi-Fi trademark, was founded and the first amendements to the Wi-Fi standard were registered as IEEE 802.11a and IEEE 802.11b. They allowed speeds up to 11 Mbit/s and proved to be popular.",
            "Over the years, many further amendements have been published, namely g, n, ad and the latest: ac, released in December 2013 and which allows speeds of nearly 7Gbit/s.",
            "Wi-Fi is now wildly used, with nearly all computers and smartphones having a chip built-in and many homes having a Wi-Fi capable router installed."

            "In the late 1990s, the Web became accessible to everyone, even to the middle class, due to the advent of commercial ISPs (Internet Service Providers). This enormous growth of the online market made online business hot. Everyone was betting on these new e-businesses and if you wanted to get into stock trading, then was the time. Investing in online businesses, it didn't matter which, was considered the best bet you could make. Stocks soared high, the Web was the future.",
            "But of course, there was a downside. At that time, nearly all online businesses used the same strategy: invest as much money as you can get, make sure you grow as fast as possible, that you are as far ahead of the competition as you can possibly get. Only then start thinking about profits. Obviously, this didn't last very long. At the end of the year 1999 and the beginning of the year 2000, stock traders realized what a big riscs they were taking. They began to be more careful, but the still growing confidence of the companies asked for more money. Then, the first companies imploded, and within a year, the rest followed, like a domino, until nothing was left of the recently so glorious economy.",
            "Many companies, like Pets.com (probably the most famous example) went completely bankrupt, but a few managed to keep themselves alive. Amazon.com, for example, saw its stocks go first from $18 to over $100, before crashing back to under $10 after the burst of the Bubble. After the crash they slowly recovered, with stocks going $35 apiece in 2005 and over $400 in 2015."

            "Since Tim Berners-lee's first description and implementation of the Web in the 1990s, the Web has changed. 20 years ago, web pages consisted of (scientific) text, later on some images, and a few links to relevant pages. But now, computers are so common and an order of magnitude more powerful than those back then, that this structure wasn't well suited anymore. We want fast, beautiful, usable experiences, instant communication, interactivity and so much more. Just a bit of text won't solve the problem anymore.",
            "The term <i>Web 2.0</i> was first coined by Darci DiNucci in 1999, but was only popularized in 2004 by Tim O'Reilly and Dale Dougherty at a special conference. They hadn't any specific technical changes in mind, but rather a new way of publishing things on and using the Web.",
            "Nearly at the same time, Mozilla and Opera teamed up to form the WHATWG, about wich I told you in '<i>The Browser Wars</i>', and which was instructed to work on some new technologies that would make the much needed evolution of the Web possible.",
            "Now, about 10 years later, the WHATWG has produced a lot of exciting new things, many of which are still being implemented by browser makers. The most notable features include: communication with the server without refreshing the page (AJAX, WebSockets); new HTML tags that improve its semantics (like &lt;main&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, etc); many additions to CSS (CSS3); a lot of new JavaScript APIs allowing much deeper integration with the client computer (ECMAScript 5 and 6); and a lot of other cool stuff! This huge amount of improvements to the Web is usually referred to as <i>HTML5</i> - this term is <i>Web 2.0</i>'s technical counterpart.",
            "All these efforts have lead to big change in how the Web is being used: 20 years ago, web pages consisted of text and links, now we are used to full-blown interactive and instant applications like Facebook, GMail and many more."
