            "On 7 march 1876, Alexander Graham Bell registers a patent for \"the method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically (...)\". In simpler terms: the telephone.<br />Of course, many other scientists were working on the telephone, including Thomas Edison, Elisha Gray and Antonio Meucci, leading to many lawsuits about patent claims in the years following the registering of Bell's patent. However, Bell won all the battles.",
            "In 1877, A. G. Bell founded the Bell Telephone Company, the company that would run the phone lines for the forseeable future and would - as we now know - play a vital role in our story."

            "Around the 1900s, the Bell Telephone Company (by that time called AT&T) was having a few problems. First, they had trouble using inter-continental phone lines: while travelling through thousands of kilometers of wire, the signals would get weaker and weaker, and arriving at the other end of the line, they were barely audible. Luckily, a few scientists were already experimenting with vacuum tubes, and they found out that they were not only able to amplify signals, but perform some logic tasks also. Within a few years, vacuum tubes were used all over the telephone networks to amplify and relay connections.",
            "But, again a few years later, vacuum tubes turned out to be bulky, unreliable and very power hungry. So, at the end of World War II, a research team, including Bill Shockley, Walter Brattain and John Bardeen, was created at Bell Labs - AT&T's research arm - to develop an alternative to these tubes.",
            "In 1945, Shockley had designed what he hoped would be the first semiconductor amplifier. The device was a cylinder, coated with silicon and mounted close to a small, metal plate. Unfortunately, it didn't work.",
            "In 1947, Brattain tried putting this whole device in a tub of water, and surprisingly, it worked ... a little bit.",
            "Following more experiments, Brattain replaced the silicon with germanium and used gold instead of metal. These changes allowed a much better amplification. They had invented the point-contact transistor.",
            "However, Shockley was furious because he hadn't been involved directly with the invention, so he set to work and, a month later, he came up with a new design, the junction transistor, which was a lot easier to manufacture.",
            "The transistor went on to replace the bulky vacuum tubes and allowed a much faster evolution of the world of electronics."

            "Let's be clear about this: <b>the</b> first computer doesn't exist: it was an evolution beginning a long, long time ago.",
            "The first 'computers' were simple computation aids, like counting rods, counting frames (abacus), tally sticks, slide rules, sectors, etc. Whether they can count as computers is highly susceptible.",
            "During the Hellenistic period, many complex devices were used to perform complex calculations. Good examples are the planisphere - a mechanical star chart - and the astrolabe, which was used to solve astronomy problems.",
            "When the Roman Empire fell and the Middle Ages began, however, humanity was back to the simple calculation aids. Until, closer to the nineteenth century, analog computers saw the light of day. Analog computers are a class of mechanical devices that are made for a specific purpose, which is baked in the design: they perform one task or one type of calculations, much like the Hellenistic devices. Again, whether they count as computers is highly susceptible.",
            "During the nineteenth century, some engineers already experimented with general-purpose, programmable devices. But, limited by the mechanical nature of the devices, they weren't very successful.",
            "At the beginning of the twentieth century, a turning point was reached. In 1936, Alan Turing - arguably the greatest computer scientist of all times - published his paper 'On Computable Numbers', in which he deals with many topics that now make up the fundamentals of computer science. One such topic is the fully programmable machine: a machine that knows a basic set of operations and can then be programmed to follow an algorithm using those operations. In other words: a computer, as we know it.",
            "Using vacuum tubes, and later transistors, this new concept was being applied en masse in new computers built all around the globe. The Bell Telephone Company, the military, lots of universities and a lot of other companies quickly started using the new computers, for all sorts of tasks.",
            "The only problem was that vacuum tubes and even transistors were still quite bulky: to build a computer you need a few thousand transistors. That's why around 1970 the idea of a 'microprocessor' emerged: a integrated electrical circuit, consisting of thousands of miniscule transistors, all placed on a single small chip. In 1971, this became a reality: Intel unveiled the 4004, the first 4-bit microprocessor. From there, the growth of the computer industry seems unstoppable."
