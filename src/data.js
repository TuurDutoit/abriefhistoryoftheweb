            "On 7 march 1876, Alexander Graham Bell registers a patent for \"the method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically (...)\". In simpler terms: the telephone.<br />Of course, many other scientists were working on the telephone, including Thomas Edison, Elisha Gray and Antonio Meucci, leading to many lawsuits about patent claims in the years following the registering of Bell's patent. However, Bell won all the battles.",
            "In 1877, A. G. Bell founded the Bell Telephone Company, the company that would run the phone lines for the forseeable future and would - as we now know - play a vital role in our story."
